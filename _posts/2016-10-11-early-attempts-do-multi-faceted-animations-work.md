This was the first week we really kicked into the project. Liam printed out a starter template that reminds me of a pizza cut into 12 segments and we set to experimenting with basic hand drawn animation. Makes you appreciate how good the disney hand illustartors were at this stuff.

My rudimentary attempts are much simpler by comparison and my goal was just to get it animating and start to test the constraints of the medium.

My biggest progression this week was considering how multiple frames are viewable at once I pondered if I could create images that rotated across multiple scenes while still animating within a single scene.

I've tested this with some friendly lizzards, the idea being that the body just rotates around the page and it's the legs that animate within a single frame. All up Im happy with the effect.

I've also realised how hard it is to get a nice hand drawn walk cycle (aka Disney above). That's something Im going to continue to practice with.
