This was the first week we really kicked into the project. Liam created out a starter template that reminds me of a pizza cut into 12 segments and we set to experimenting with basic hand drawn animation. It makes you appreciate how good the Disney hand illustators were at this.

My rudimentary attempts are much simpler by comparison and my goal was just to get it animating and start to test the constraints of the medium.

My biggest progression this week was considering how multiple frames are viewable at once I pondered if I could create images that rotated across multiple scenes while still animating within a single scene.

I've tested this with some friendly lizzards, the idea being that the body just rotates around the page and it's the legs that animate within a single frame. All up I'm happy with the effect.

YES multifacted animations can work.

I've also been reminded of how hard it is to get a nice hand drawn walk cycle (aka Disney above). That's something I'm going to continue to practice with.

*Ps. Im still working out a nice workflow so that I can take videos and quickly generate animated gifs that I can drop in here without people having to press play. The gif creator that I used this week incorrectly flipped the video up-side-down and added a watermark. When I find a better option I'll come back and redo this video.*
