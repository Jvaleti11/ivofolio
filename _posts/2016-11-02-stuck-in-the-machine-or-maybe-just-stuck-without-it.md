This week I continue to work with my hands and hand illustrate my animations.

Liam cooked up an ingenious light box using an clear plastic lunchbox and our phone torches as a light source. *I'll get a pic up of it shortly.*

Today's theme is "Stuck in the machine".

Here the smart phone provided a consistent visual image, the concept questioning are we trapped using our phones, are they now something we can never get away from?

It's hard creating new animations knowing that they just won't come out looking polished. Creating hand animations is just hard.

Here I experimented with drawing in black and white in pencil. A basic phone outline as well as hand and arm formed the first frame and were then used as a base for the rest of the frames.

I like the hand drawn style and think it attracts attention but where I can see obvious issues is that I got too close to the smartphone so that the bottom of the image blends unintentionally from one frame to the next and also its not completely ibvious that the hand is pressed up against the glass following the horrow trope of being stuck inside.

I think the concept has merit, Im happy with what I learnt from this early experiment. It goes without saying that this would need further refinement to better make my intentions obvious.
