With the most of the planning out of the way, this week we've got together and got started on building the praxiniscope project. As with a lot of projects, it's difficult to know where to start when theres a mountian of work and so many unknowns. While this is daunting, I've decidied to jump straight into solving the technical problems and move from there. We located the cheapest record player available online and used the instructions for building a faceted mirror prisim from [Random Motion](http://http://www.randommotion.com/html/prax2.html) and got going on animating. 

Initally we we're using cheap reflective cardboard for our mirror. While this was good to get us started it didnt produce very detailed animations and gave a slight warping to the images. Today I put together a new mirror prisim using reflective acrilic, and while it is harder to cut and assemble, produces far better results. 

To start we are producing all animatons by hand, creating lo-fi mockups that can later be digitized and refined. To do this I've created a simple circular template with twelve sectioned gridlines that we can print off many copies of, draw up our ideas and put them straight on the record player. We strated with some fairly random simple drawings but I'm now trying to produce anthing that is at least tied to the concept of humans and technology so that we can continue building on ideas and themes while solving the technical problems. 

Progression on our animations has been fast, starting with Richie's simple bouncing dot, to more complex layerd drawings. A few things notcied straight away we're, firstly while your mind tells you to draw onto the disc in a clockwise direction in order to produce your animation loop, this actually makes your animation run backwards! Even after realising this, it's so hammered into my head to progress left to right that I've contuned to make the same mistake on many of the discs i drew on. This isnt such a big deal on some loops, but makes others difficult to iunderstand. The second point we found is that while it seems logical to draw each of the 12 illustraions consecutivly, your aniamtion ends up far messier doung it this way. Instead we've been drawing your first illustration, then heading to the oppisite side of the circle to the half way mark, and then to the two sides in between that, like you were tuning a drum. This makes the result much smoother and less makes get made.

Finally in order to produce consistent illustrations that arent morphing and mutating, I've started drawing a master image and tracing. Tracing can be annoying and hard without a light source, and constantly leaning on windows is annoying, so I've come up with a fun solution. Blocking out the sides of a lunchbox with paper and putting an phone with a torch or bike light inside creates an awesome adhoc light box. This has enabled me to quickly trace the rough shapes of images onto the page and then refine them afterwards. 

Overall things are off to a good start, and while there are still a lot of problems to solve and decisions to make, we're having fun and enjoying the project.
